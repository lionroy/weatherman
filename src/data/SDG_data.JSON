        "cdata": "The development objective of the  Sustainable Rural Water and Sanitation Project for Ghana is to expand access to, and ensure sustainable water supply and sanitation services in rural and small town communities in six regions. This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional credit in an amount of SDR 33 million (USD 45.7 million equivalent) to the Project. The proposed additional credit would finance the cost of completing the remaining contracts for works and services under the SRWSP which could not be executed as a result of cost\u2013overruns resulting from: (a) the fact that communities had significantly outgrown the initial design capacities thus requiring a redesign of both the transmission and distribution mains; (b) the need to bolster the capacities of pipelines, pumps and storage tanks in the 15 small town systems initially targeted for rehabilitation in the Northern region to cover the larger than estimated population and geographic dispersion of towns; (c) extension of some small town water supply systems to adjoining communities not included in the original plan; and (d) the selection of additional beneficiary communities in the Upper West region. The Project Paper also proposes a project restructuring to extend the closing date from June 30, 2017 to December 31, 2019 and to adjust the results framework, disbursement estimates, component costs, and implementation schedule. The additional financing (AF) will assist Ghana in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) related to equitable access to safe and affordable water and adequate sanitation for all by 2030. While Ghana is on track to achieving the goal for water supply, that for sanitation is significantly off track, with coverage estimated at only 14 percent compared to the SDG target of 80 percent. The proposed AF will place appropriate emphasis on (a) san"

        "cdata": "The development objective of Fourth Transformation of Agriculture Sector Program and Second Phase of Program-for-Results Project for Rwanda is to promote the commercialization of agriculture value chains in Rwanda. Rwanda is increasingly recognized as a global example in the pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and in preparing for the global challenges of climate change. Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI) has prepared its fourth Strategic Plan for Agriculture Transformation (PSTA4), an articulation of how the government proposes to implement the updated National Agricultural Policy (NAP). PSTA4 is also aligned with National Policies and Strategies including Vision 2050, Rwanda\u2019s National Strategy for Transformation (NST 1), and relevant sub-sector strategies. This Program for Results (PforR) operation will be nested within PSTA4. Reflecting emerging best-practice with PforR operations, the specifics of the PforR Program are drawn from the broader PSTA4 and nested within the government\u2019s strategy. The PforR operation directly addresses the objectives of the World Bank\u2019s engagement in Rwanda and capitalizes on the World Bank\u2019s comparative advantage. It is aligned with the objectives of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) (FY2014 \u2013 2020), particularly in improving the productivity and incomes of the poor through rural development and social protection, by supporting investments in activities that promote agricultural productivity, agribusiness and nutrition. This PforR Program\u2019s four results areas would address areas reflect the Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD) concept by focusing on the overall policy context (Results Area 1), recognizing that a key element of the new NAP/PSTA4 is leveraging private sector investment in the commercialization agenda (Results Area 2), but that there remains a need for the public provision of s"
