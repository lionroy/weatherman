The second component is the Improving resilience of households. Activities under component two will focus on the expansion of Chad\u2019s social protection system to include poor and vulnerable refugee and host community households in selected areas. This component seeks to provide more targeted assistance to improve the resilience of the poorest/most vulnerable households through cash assistance (sub-component 2.1) and productive measures (sub-component 2.2). All activities will be targeted at the household level, utilizing a combination of targeting approaches. The third component is the strengthening country systems to support refugees and host communities. This component will finance investments aimed at strengthening government systems to manage current and future refugee situations, with a focus on two main areas: (a) enhancing CNARR\u2019s capacity to carry out its institutional mandate; and (b) improving social protection systems.

Building on the first DPO, the operation continues to support the reform agenda of the Government of Tuvalu (GoT) in the critical areas of: (i) improving health and education service delivery; and (ii) building macroeconomic sustainability. These two areas are central to the GoT\u2019s National Strategy for Sustainable Development (NSSD) or Te Kakeega III (TKIII), and to the Regional Partnership Framework (RPF) for nine small Pacific Island Countries FY2017\u2010FY2022 including Tuvalu. The DPO is part of a coordinated budget support mechanism through which Australia, New Zealand, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the European Union (EU) also provide budget support. The DPO focuses on improving the delivery of education and health services and improving macroeconomic stability. The reforms under the first pillar, improving social service delivery, are focused on improving longer\u2010term education outcomes through supporting improved early childhood education and care (ECCE); and supporting improved health sector outcomes through reducing risk factors for non\u2010communicable diseases (NCDs). The reforms under the second pillar of the operation aim at improving macroeconomic stability through strengthening the investment management of the country\u2019s reserve assets; improving the costing and budgeting for public sector wage\u2010bill decisions; and operationalizing the framework for banking oversight. Financing provided through this operation will continue to directly support the maintenance of fiscal buffers and meet Tuvalu\u2019s long\u2010term financing needs. The operation will also sustain the reform momentum built throughout the previous operations in the current and the previous programmatic series of DPOs. This second operation of a programmatic series is expected to suppo"

The operation continues supporting the reforms started under the same the two pillars of the first operation of this DPF series, with the inclusion of a third pillar on social services. The first pillar continues to focus on strengthening fiscal management. The second pillar aims at enhancing agricultural productivity through value addition and improving power sector\u2019s financial viability. This operation entails two important changes with respect to the previous operation of this DPF series. The first is that a third pillar supporting a more equitable provision of education and health care services has been introduced. The inclusion of a third pillar reflects the results of the Benin systematic country diagnostic approved in January 2018 and the renewed commitment of authorities in this area. The second change in the operation is that it will include both an IDA Credit and an IDA policy-based guarantee (PBG). These two changes do not modify, and rather increase, the rationale for WBG support, which is to support the implementation of the GAP and the program for growth and sustainable development (PC2D). The  project is fully anchored in the World Bank Group\u2019s maximizing financing for development (MFD) approach. The reforms in both fiscal policy and social services should also help encourage private sector participation as macroeconomic as well as fiscal stability and human capital are key factors for firms\u2019 investment and productivity."

There are four components to the project, the first component being gender-based violence prevention and integrated support for survivors at community level. The project will support the delivery of an integrated package of prevention of GBV and targeted assistance to survivors at the community level while promoting gender equality, behavioral change and violence prevention in the targeted health zones. The second component is the response to gender-based violence. Complementing GBV prevention activities and the immediate support for groups most at risk of GBV, put in place at community level, the project will also strengthen front-line service provision for survivors with a strong focus on improving: (a) multi-sectoral response for the most complex cases and; (b) the quality of medical services. Building on the experience of the GL GBV project and the challenges in operationalizing activities with the health sector, the project will strengthen service provision through integrated Centers of Excellence (CoE) with a focus on outreach activities and supporting de-centralized One Stop Centers at Health Zone level. The project will also invest in targeted capacity building of the health sector to bring medical services for survivors of GBV closer to communities. This component includes two subcomponents: support for existing integrated centers of excellence, and strengthening the health sector response to GBV. The third component is the support to policy development, "

        "cdata": "The objective of the Skills and Employment for Tongans Project is to improve opportunities for secondary school progression and facilitate the transition to jobs in the domestic and overseas labor markets for Tongans. There are four components to the project, the first component being Conditional cash transfer program for secondary school enrolment and attendance. Component one will incentivize secondary school progression and completion through the provision of cash transfers. It will address the financial constraints poor and vulnerable households face in access and retention and will provide the necessary motivation for students to stay in school. The guiding principle of this component will be to provide the right incentive for these households to both encourage secondary school enrolment and ensure regular attendance through to completion. The project will fund both the TA required to establish the cash transfer program and the funds required for the transfers. This component includes two subcomponents: technical assistance required to establish CCT, and cash transfers and bonus payments. The second component is the strengthening TVET provision. Component two aims to strengthen the provision of TVET in Tonga to support the skills development of Tongans and make them more competitive in the global and domestic labor market. The goal is to improve TVET services across different levels within the education and skills system of Tonga, including the Government, employers, training providers, the quality assurance system through the TNQAB, and most importantly, the trainees or students. This component includes three subcomponents: improving the quality of TVET, TVET student support funds, and strengthening governance of the TVET sector. The third component is the enhancing opportunities for labor migration. Component three will enhance opportunities for Tongans to acce"

The AF will help to scale up the Investment Co-Financing Facility (ICF) component (component two) of the F4J II project and finance eligible job-creating investment opportunities identified from the private sector. The AF could finance proposals received through the recent ICF call for proposals completed in April 2018, or from future calls for proposals as needed. The ICF is a risk-sharing facility that provides co-financing to commercially viable private sector investments that would otherwise not proceed due to the high risk fragile, conflict, and violence (FCV) environment. The AF is timely to capitalize on the strong demand from the private sector for risk-sharing co-financing provided by the ICF component, while also operationalizing the World Bank Group\u2019s Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD) agenda and the FY18-21 Assistance Strategy for the West Bank and Gaza."

This program document describes the Fourth Financial Sector Stability Development Policy Credit (DPC4) to the GoN, in the amount of SDR 71.1 million (US$100 million equivalent). The initial IDA Financial Sector Stability Credit approved in June 2013, was a stand-alone single tranche credit in the amount of USD 30 million equivalent). The second and third credits (each in the amount of USD 100 million equivalent, and approved in June 2015 and March 2017, respectively), were designed in a programmatic series of three operations. The series has four pillars: (a) enhancing financial sector development; (b) restructuring and consolidating the financial system; (c) strengthening the legal and regulatory framework; and (d) enhancing the governance and transparency of the banking system.The proposed operation is consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY2014\u20132017 that acknowledges the persistent financial sector weakness and the risk it poses to macroeconomic stability and economic growth. The Performance and Learning Review (PLR, FY2017) of the CPS also acknowledges the progress made through the series of DPCs, particularly in addressing the capital adequacy of state-owned banks, strengthening inspection and compliance, ensuring overall financial sector stability and contributing to access to finance. The Systematic Country Diagnostic (FY2018) highlights financial sector stability and inclusion as important aspects for broader economic growth and poverty reduction.

There are three components to the project, the first component being participatory mapping and agrarian reform. The objective of this component is to produce village level parcel boundary maps in the project target areas, record all land right claims, and facilitate land rights regularization and registration in the Electronic Land Administration System (eLand), covering all legal rights including communal rights, and joint and individual ownership registration for women. The approach is participatory and inclusive with regular community consultations and engagement during implementation. The component will finance: (i) preparatory data acquisition, collection and processing for PTSL; (ii) inclusive and participatory implementation of PTSL in project target provinces; (iii) development of eLand; and (iv) rolling out of eLand in project regencies; and (v) land rights regularization and registration in the eLand system, and (vi) land rights documents issuance; and (vii) legal assistance, and support to dispute resolution and appeals. The second component is the geospatial data infrastructure for environmental and natural resource management. The objective of this component is to improve the access to and the availability of geospatial information for agrarian reform, land and tenure rights regularization and administration, and environmental and natural resource management in the target provinces. The project will (i) support the densification of the CORS network; (ii) strengthen the NSDI technology infrastructure and services; and (iii) support the geo-referencing of existing data of high-resolution satellite imagery (in LAPAN37) for the working map in project target areas.

        "cdata": "The development objective of the  Clean Energy Development Project is to assist Colombia in increasing electricity generation capacity from non-conventional renewable energy sources and energy savings in the industrial sector, through mobilization of private investment. The Project consists of one or more IBRD Guarantees in an aggregate amount of up to USD 4118 million and a Clean Technology Fund (CTF) Guarantee in an amount of up to USD 40 million to backstop Financiera de Desarrollo Nacional (FDN\u2019s) payment obligations. The key rationale for IBRD and CTF Guarantees is to help, through FDN, the Republic of Colombia (ROC) in establishing a long-term and creditworthy offtake market, thereby building a track record for long term investments in clean energy. FDN will explore two main functions to catalyze the market for small scale renewable energy generation and energy efficiency initiatives. The first function involves designing and developing credit enhancement and risk mitigation products to help mobilize long term financing for clean energy sector. The second function involves reviewing the potential for implementation of an aggregation vehicle to reduce transaction costs and attract commercial financing for small scale Sub-projects. It is important to note that support to small scale renewables (behind the meter) and energy efficiency are considered only as pilot activities that seek to plant the seeds to demonstrate the implementation potential for further development of the market. Under the PER Account, FDN will create two windows to provide IBRD/CTF Eligible Financial Products, one for Large Scale Renewable Energy (LSRE) Sub-projects and the other for Small Scale Subprojects (SSE) Sub-projects. IBRD and CTF Guarantees support FDN in offering cost effective IBRD/CTF Eligible Financial Products and in obtaining additional leverage. The innovative and efficient ap"

The additional financing (AF) will strengthen the development impact of the project by reinforcing support for critical priorities along the fiscal management value chain. The changes introduced under the AF will involve an expansion of the scope of the work initially envisaged by the parent project in the following key areas: (a) expanding the tax base and optimizing revenue mobilization through scaled up support for land registration pilots and reinforcing audit capacity in the mining sector, (b) strengthening statistical and macroeconomic and fiscal forecasting capacity and enhancing medium term programming and budgeting processes, and (c) enhancing the processing capacities and functionalities of the government financial management information system (GFMIS) through the modernization and interfacing of the two core budgeting and treasury accounting information systems. The AF entails project restructuring to: (a) revise the development objective to reflect the expanded scope of the project; (b) rationalize and consolidate project components, re-allocate costs across components, and introduce new activities; and (c) modify the project results framework to facilitate better monitoring of the development impact of existing and scaled-up activities."

It has two project components. First component, Capitalize the Partial Credit Guarantee Fund will support the capitalization of the Credit Guarantee Fund (CGF) for the provision of Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme (PCGs) to participating lenders (PLs). Second component, Project Management, Operating Costs, and Lender Training will support the Eastern Caribbean Partial Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECPCGC), which is responsible for the coordination, implementation, and supervision of the project. The project will finance, among others: (a) the recruitment and training of the ECPCGC team members; (b) training of loan officers at the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) supervised lenders; (c) the acquisition of goods such as equipment, software, and furniture for the ECPCGC; (d) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities; (e) the financing of operating costs; and (f) the carrying out of minor works for the installation of any necessary computer hardware and minor refurbishing works of office facilities. The funds under this component will also be used to cover the annual audits of the firm\u2019s activities, which are required by the ECPCGC Agreement. It will be important to review the contractual arrangements for the audit, including the terms of reference."

The operation is designed to support the implementation of the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for the period 2016-2018, known as the \u2018Cadre Strat\u00e9gique pour la Relance Economique et le D\u00e9veloppement Durable du Mali\u2019 (Strategic Cadre for Economic Recovery and Durable Development - CREDD). The CREDD, the 2015 Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) and the FY16-19 Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Mali are all closely aligned. The PRIGSO operations support the policies defined in the CREDD by fostering inclusive growth and supporting pro-poor (decentralized) transfers and social protection. This is the second operation of a series comprising two single tranche operations. The first credit (p157900) in the amount of US$50 million was approved in May 2017. Previous development policy operation (DPO) series supported efforts to address the twin challenges of fiscal consolidation while also tackling governance problems by focusing on strengthening Public Financial Management (PFM) and Governance. Reforms supported in the past included efforts to improve budget transparency, strengthen fiduciary and establishment of controls, and improve public investment management, as well as actions to reduce opportunities for corruption, accelerate public procurement and build local government financial management capacity. The present series, by contrast, aims to sustain the foundations for inclusive economic growth, decentralization and protection of the most vulnerable. The dialogue on PFM reforms is mainly driven by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with the supp"

There are two components to the project, the first component being EE facility for efficient street lighting and industrial energy efficiency. This component includes two subcomponents: private financing for ESL and IEE subprojects, to provide sub-loans to beneficiaries for ESL subprojects and IEE subprojects through a loan syndication with commercial lenders, led by CEF; and credit enhancement products - the project will capitalize the GF to allow credit enhancement products for ESL subprojects and IEE subprojects. Finally, the second component is the Technical Assistance (TA) consisting of GCF US$4 million recipient executed grant, and US$1 million Bank executed grants provided by the Global Infrastructure Facility (GIF) and ESMAP. The TA component of this project will support essential technical studies, capacity building for the departments of CEF involved, and early operational costs. In the case of IEE, these funds will be used to support technical studies and initial implementation efforts (for example, structuring of off-balance-sheet funds to support scale-up of IEE investment). In the case of ESL, the TA will support cities\u2019 preparation of high-quality PPP subprojects. The GIF and ESMAP funds are being used to support financial structuring of the project and to conduct pre-feasibility studies for PPPs for ESL subprojects in selected cities. A detailed procurement plan and procurement strategy for the recipient executed TA funds (GCF) have been prepared"

The project is composed of an IDA Guarantee or equivalent in West African CFA franc (CFAF) that will support CI-ENERGIES in raising equivalent amount in long-term commercial financing. This new debt will be used to restructure or replace a substantial portion of the sector\u2019s existing short-term commercial debt accumulated at the level of the Ivorian Electricity Company (CIE) the private operator and to repay arrears to Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and gas suppliers. IDA Guarantee will accomplish this by enhancing CI-ENERGIES\u2019 credit quality and enable the company to raise new commercial debt with a lower interest rate and longer tenor than what would be available on a stand-alone basis. The cost of CI-ENERGIES\u2019 existing commercial debt ranges between seven percent and eight percent for tenors of six to twelve years in local currency. IDA-guaranteed new commercial debt is expected to both reduce the level of interest paid by CI-ENERGIES and extend the tenor of its financing."

Through the AF, the project will be restructured to: (i) adjust the results framework and monitoring indicators to reflect increased targets associated with the scaled up investments; (ii) reallocate loan proceeds from category 2 to category 1 of the original loan; (iii) trigger OP-BP 4.09 pest management policy; (iv) change the applicable procurement regulations; (v) extend the closing date of the original loan by one year; and (vi) extend the overall project closing date from December 29, 2019 to April 30, 2023 to allow sufficient time for the completion of planned activities under the AF and, ultimately, full achievement of the scaled up project development objective (PDO) and intermediate results indicators."

This entails establishing SP systems, scaling up the coverage of SP programs and improving their quality, as well as building the institutional framework, developing coordination mechanisms and strengthening capacities in SP. support to this agenda will be provided through financing the following three subcomponents: support for the social protection system, institutional capacity building and learning, and project management. The second component is the community-based CFW program. This component will draw on the extensive experience of World Bank-funded projects with CFW in the Democratic Republic of Congo, particularly through the STEP. It will provide CFW opportunities to poor households with the aim to increase their income, support them in developing sustainable productive activities, and rehabilitate socioeconomic infrastructures for the community at large.  The third component is the cash transfers. This component will support the implementation of a prototype unconditional cash transfer program.

This second operation in the DPL series builds on the first operation to support the government\u2019s overall objective to reduce the costs and improve the reliability of the logistics chain in Indonesia. Its design has benefited from an extensive collaboration between the government, in particular the Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs (CMEA), the Indonesia National Single Window (INSW) Portal Administrator, the Ministry of Transport, and the Ministry of Finance, and the World Bank. The level of Government\u2019s ownership of the operation is high. The government has seen the DPL as a clear opportunity to further galvanize ministries and agencies around an ambitious reform program on logistics, including on core logistics services and on the further strengthening of the INSW. The early results of the DPL series are encouraging, with significant progress across the three main pillars. The World Bank monitoring work suggests that the reforms supported by the DPL have already started to make an impact in a number of areas, including an acceleration of new port projects with additional private participation, increased entry of operators including foreign in various logistics markets port investments and the reduction of time and costs of trade processing."

The project comprises of four components. The first component, solar hybrid mini grids for rural economic development will be implemented under a market-based private sector led approach to construct, operate, and maintain economically viable mini grids, supported by subsidies that reduce initial capital outlays. It consists of following sub-components: (i) minimum subsidy tender for mini grids; and (ii) performance-based grants program. The second component, stand-alone solar systems for homes and MSMEs goal is significantly increase the market for stand-alone solar systems in Nigeria in order to provide access to electricity to more than one million Nigerian households and MSMEs at lower cost than their current means of service such as small diesel gensets. It consists of following sub-components: (i) market scale-up challenge grants; and (ii) performance-based grants. The third component, energizing education objective is to provide reliable, affordable, and sustainable power to public universities and associated teaching hospitals. The fourth component, technical assistance is designed to build a framework for rural electrification upscaling, support project implementation as well as broad capacity building in Rural Electrification Agency (REA), Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), Federal Ministry of Power, Works, and Housing (FMPWH), and other relevant stakeholders."

The program will support the full and sustained implementation of a strategic subset of reforms from the FSP and the open government partnership (OGP) commitments that are implemented at the state-level. The PforR will cover the fiscal performance of states over four fiscal years: 2018-2021. The program will provide performance-based financing on an annual basis to states which have been verified through the annual performance assessments (APA) as having: (1) complied with the annual eligibility criteria; and (2) achieved the annual disbursement linked results (DLRs)."

The post\u20102011 refugee influx has deepened Jordan\u2019s labor abundance, but it did not alter the structural pattern of job creation Currently, job growth is concentrated in low productivity sectors with localized markets and limited attractiveness to efficiency\u2010seeking investment. Going forward, Jordan is seeking to build resilience into its economy by raising productivity, expanding domestic markets through improved access to finance and stronger institutions for managing risk, and opening new external markets. Jordan's previously successful formula for coping with geopolitical challenges has run into new trends of lower grants, remittances, and investment flows. While the new government will have the benefit of a fresh start on building consensus for reforms, it faces heightened uncertainty over the summer, necessitating accelerated international support. Although Jordan\u2019s adaptability in hosting refugees is intrinsic to its history, the economic context for the latest influx has posed particular challenges. Recent poverty data are not available, but earlier declines in poverty are likely to have halted or even reversed for Jordanians. Jordan's response to the country\u2019s productivity, jobs, and conflict spillover challenges is to seek international support for the fiscal costs of the spillovers, while using that support to catalyze reforms capable of generating productive jobs in a labor\u2010abundant economy. The Government of Jordan (GoJ) is putting together a five\u2010year priority reform program for equitable growth and job creation whose objective is to set the foundations for higher growth. The program responds to the challenges of p"

There are four components to the project, the first component being strengthen primary healthcare, family planning and community activities. This component will mainly finance results using Disbursement-linked Indicators (DLIs) achieved and verified by an independent verification agency (IVA) although there are specific activities under this component which will also be financed using the regular Investment Project Financing (IPF) disbursement method. This component includes four subcomponents: providing for quality services at PHCs; strengthen community health worker (CHW) program; supporting health and family planning activities; and screening for Hep C and risk factors for high burden diseases. The second component is the strengthen secondary level care. This component will strengthen the integration of services through enhancing procedures, logistics and operations that will empower hospitals to provide comprehensive quality services to the population residing in their catchment areas. Further, the component will finance the costs associated with accreditation activities as per the national accreditation guidelines for hospitals. The component will also enhance activities aiming at maintaining safe blood supply to the population to cut back on one of the highest sources of viral infection for Hep C. Lastly, the component will finance the costs associated with medical treatment of Hep C patients. This component includes three subcomponents: providing for quality services at hospitals; improve the blood bank network; and treatment of Hep C. The third component is the institutional capacity building and "
