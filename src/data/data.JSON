These two areas are central to the GoT\u2019s National Strategy for Sustainable Development (NSSD) or Te Kakeega III (TKIII), and to the Regional Partnership Framework (RPF) for nine small Pacific Island Countries FY2017\u2010FY2022 including Tuvalu. The DPO is part of a coordinated budget support mechanism through which Australia, New Zealand, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the European Union (EU) also provide budget support. The DPO focuses on improving the delivery of education and health services and improving macroeconomic stability. The reforms under the first pillar, improving social service delivery, are focused on improving longer\u2010term education outcomes through supporting improved early childhood education and care (ECCE); and supporting improved health sector outcomes through reducing risk factors for non\u2010communicable diseases (NCDs). The reforms under the second pillar of the operation aim at improving macroeconomic stability through strengthening the investment management of the country\u2019s reserve assets; improving the costing and budgeting for public sector wage\u2010bill decisions; and operationalizing the framework for banking oversight. Financing provided through this operation will continue to directly support the maintenance of fiscal buffers and meet Tuvalu\u2019s long\u2010term financing needs. The operation will also sustain the reform momentum built throughout the previous operations in the current and the previous programmatic series of DPOs.

The operation continues supporting the reforms started under the same the two pillars of the first operation of this DPF series, with the inclusion of a third pillar on social services. The first pillar continues to focus on strengthening fiscal management. The second pillar aims at enhancing agricultural productivity through value addition and improving power sector\u2019s financial viability. This operation entails two important changes with respect to the previous operation of this DPF series. The first is that a third pillar supporting a more equitable provision of education and health care services has been introduced. The inclusion of a third pillar reflects the results of the Benin systematic country diagnostic approved in January 2018 and the renewed commitment of authorities in this area. The second change in the operation is that it will include both an IDA Credit and an IDA policy-based guarantee (PBG). These two changes do not modify, and rather increase, the rationale for WBG support, which is to support the implementation of the GAP and the program for growth and sustainable development (PC2D). The  project is fully anchored in the World Bank Group\u2019s maximizing financing for development (MFD) approach. The reforms in both fiscal policy and social services should also help encourage private sector participation as macroeconomic as well as fiscal stability and human capital are key factors for firms\u2019 investment and productivity."

The AF will help to scale up the Investment Co-Financing Facility (ICF) component (component two) of the F4J II project and finance eligible job-creating investment opportunities identified from the private sector. The AF could finance proposals received through the recent ICF call for proposals completed in April 2018, or from future calls for proposals as needed. The ICF is a risk-sharing facility that provides co-financing to commercially viable private sector investments that would otherwise not proceed due to the high risk fragile, conflict, and violence (FCV) environment. The AF is timely to capitalize on the strong demand from the private sector for risk-sharing co-financing provided by the ICF component, while also operationalizing the World Bank Group\u2019s Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD) agenda and the FY18-21 Assistance Strategy for the West Bank and Gaza."

The key rationale for IBRD and CTF Guarantees is to help, through FDN, the Republic of Colombia (ROC) in establishing a long-term and creditworthy offtake market, thereby building a track record for long term investments in clean energy. FDN will explore two main functions to catalyze the market for small scale renewable energy generation and energy efficiency initiatives. The first function involves designing and developing credit enhancement and risk mitigation products to help mobilize long term financing for clean energy sector. The second function involves reviewing the potential for implementation of an aggregation vehicle to reduce transaction costs and attract commercial financing for small scale Sub-projects. It is important to note that support to small scale renewables (behind the meter) and energy efficiency are considered only as pilot activities that seek to plant the seeds to demonstrate the implementation potential for further development of the market. Under the PER Account, FDN will create two windows to provide IBRD/CTF Eligible Financial Products, one for Large Scale Renewable Energy (LSRE) Sub-projects and the other for Small Scale Subprojects (SSE) Sub-projects. IBRD and CTF Guarantees support FDN in offering cost effective IBRD/CTF Eligible Financial Products and in obtaining additional leverage. The innovative and efficient ap"

This second operation in the DPL series builds on the first operation to support the government\u2019s overall objective to reduce the costs and improve the reliability of the logistics chain in Indonesia. Its design has benefited from an extensive collaboration between the government, in particular the Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs (CMEA), the Indonesia National Single Window (INSW) Portal Administrator, the Ministry of Transport, and the Ministry of Finance, and the World Bank. The level of Government\u2019s ownership of the operation is high. The government has seen the DPL as a clear opportunity to further galvanize ministries and agencies around an ambitious reform program on logistics, including on core logistics services and on the further strengthening of the INSW. The early results of the DPL series are encouraging, with significant progress across the three main pillars. The World Bank monitoring work suggests that the reforms supported by the DPL have already started to make an impact in a number of areas, including an acceleration of new port projects with additional private participation, increased entry of operators including foreign in various logistics markets port investments and the reduction of time and costs of trade processing."

        "cdata": "The proposed First Equitable Growth and Job Creation Development Policy Financing is designed to help Jordan lay the foundations for a higher and more sustainable economic growth path, while creating more jobs for Jordanians and non\u2010Jordanians. The post\u20102011 refugee influx has deepened Jordan\u2019s labor abundance, but it did not alter the structural pattern of job creation Currently, job growth is concentrated in low productivity sectors with localized markets and limited attractiveness to efficiency\u2010seeking investment. Going forward, Jordan is seeking to build resilience into its economy by raising productivity, expanding domestic markets through improved access to finance and stronger institutions for managing risk, and opening new external markets. Jordan's previously successful formula for coping with geopolitical challenges has run into new trends of lower grants, remittances, and investment flows. While the new government will have the benefit of a fresh start on building consensus for reforms, it faces heightened uncertainty over the summer, necessitating accelerated international support. Although Jordan\u2019s adaptability in hosting refugees is intrinsic to its history, the economic context for the latest influx has posed particular challenges. Recent poverty data are not available, but earlier declines in poverty are likely to have halted or even reversed for Jordanians. Jordan's response to the country\u2019s productivity, jobs, and conflict spillover challenges is to seek international support for the fiscal costs of the spillovers, while using that support to catalyze reforms capable of generating productive jobs in a labor\u2010abundant economy. The Government of Jordan (GoJ) is putting together a five\u2010year priority reform program for equitable growth and job creation whose objective is to set the foundations for higher growth. The program responds to the challenges of p"

There are four components to the project, the first component being strengthen primary healthcare, family planning and community activities. This component will mainly finance results using Disbursement-linked Indicators (DLIs) achieved and verified by an independent verification agency (IVA) although there are specific activities under this component which will also be financed using the regular Investment Project Financing (IPF) disbursement method. This component includes four subcomponents: providing for quality services at PHCs; strengthen community health worker (CHW) program; supporting health and family planning activities; and screening for Hep C and risk factors for high burden diseases. The second component is the strengthen secondary level care. This component will strengthen the integration of services through enhancing procedures, logistics and operations that will empower hospitals to provide comprehensive quality services to the population residing in their catchment areas. Further, the component will finance the costs associated with accreditation activities as per the national accreditation guidelines for hospitals. The component will also enhance activities aiming at maintaining safe blood supply to the population to cut back on one of the highest sources of viral infection for Hep C. Lastly, the component will finance the costs associated with medical treatment of Hep C patients. This component includes three subcomponents: providing for quality services at hospitals; improve the blood bank network; and treatment of Hep C. The third component is the institutional capacity building and "
